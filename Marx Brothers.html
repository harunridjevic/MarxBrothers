			The Marx Brothers were an American family comedy act that was successful in vaudeville, on Broadway, and in
			14 motion pictures from 1905 to 1949. Five of the Marx Brothers' fourteen feature films were selected by the
			American Film Institute (AFI) as among the top 100 comedy films, with two of them, Duck Soup (1933) and A
			Night at the Opera (1935), in the top fifteen. They are widely considered by critics, scholars and fans to
			be among the greatest and most influential comedians of the 20th century. Full Cast: Groucho, Harpo, Chicho,
			Gummo, Zeppo
		</h3>

		<h4>
			The Beatles said the film was inspired by the classic Marx Brothers film Duck Soup. Duck Soup is also
			frequently cited as a major influence on the comedic side of The Beatles, and The Beatles themselves
			admitted that it was an inspiration for their film Help!
		</h4>

		<h4>
			Mystery writer Jeffrey Cohen paid tribute to the stateroom scene in his novel A Night at the Operation
			(2009). The book's title also parodies the name of the movie.
		</h4>

		<h4>
			The British rock group Queen paid homage to this film by naming their 1975 studio album after it. Their
			follow-up album, A Day at the Races, was also named after a Marx Brothers film.
		</h4>

		<h4>
			Judd Apatow, the director behind Knocked Up, the 40 Year-Old Virgin and This is 40, told The Wrap: "The
			first movie that had an impact on me as a person interested in comedy was Duck Soup.

			<h4>
				Julius Henry "Groucho" Marx was a master of quick wit and is generally considered to have been one of
				America's greatest comedians. He made 13 feature films as a team with his brothers, who performed under
				the name the Marx Brothers, of whom he was the third-born.
			</h4>

			<h4>
				His distinctive appearance, carried over from his days in vaudeville, included quirks such as an
				exaggerated stooped posture, spectacles, cigar, and a thick greasepaint mustache (later a real mustache)
				and eyebrows. These exaggerated features resulted in the creation of one of the most recognizable and
				ubiquitous novelty disguises, known as Groucho glasses: a one-piece mask consisting of horn-rimmed
				glasses, a large plastic nose, bushy eyebrows and mustache.

			<h4>
				In his memoir, Groucho wrote that Harpo simply wasn't very good at memorizing dialogue, and thus was
				ideal to portray the archetypal Vaudeville role of the "dunce who couldn't speak."
			</h4>

			<h4>
				"While Groucho and Chico were concerned with the elaborate flip-flops of their plots, Harpo was having
				fun. He was always wise to their maneuvers, and would often offer an assist or miraculously inspired
				suggestion to help the monkey business along. But invariably at some point in the scramble, Harpo and
				the pace would slow down and he would withdraw to the comfort of his harp. Then he would play sweet
				music. Love and bliss would shine in his eyes. And the pathos of being a cheerful misfit and a buffoon
				to maniacs would be revealed. There was no common sense in the character. It was a whimsey, a
				hare-brained caricature. But it sweetly suggested life's derangements and something of its haunting
				mystery."- Bosley Crowther in THE NEW YORK TIMES, September 29, 1964.
